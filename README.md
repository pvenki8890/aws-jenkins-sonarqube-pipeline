# 🚀 AWS Jenkins DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

A production-style end-to-end DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline built using Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Docker, Trivy, and AWS EC2. This project automates the software delivery lifecycle including build, testing, code quality analysis, containerization, vulnerability scanning, and Docker image publishing.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete hands-on implementation of a modern DevSecOps CI/CD workflow using Jenkins Pipeline as Code.

The pipeline was built and configured on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu server and integrates multiple DevOps tools to automate continuous integration and delivery processes for a Java Spring Boot application.

The objective of this project was to gain real-world hands-on experience with:

- CI/CD Pipeline Automation
- DevSecOps Tool Integration
- Docker Containerization
- Jenkins Shared Libraries
- Maven Build Lifecycle
- AWS Infrastructure Setup
- Troubleshooting & Pipeline Debugging

🔄 Pipeline Stages
1️⃣ Git Checkout

Jenkins pulls the latest source code from the GitHub repository.

2️⃣ Unit Testing

Maven executes automated unit tests to validate application functionality.

Tools Used
• Maven
• JUnit
3️⃣ Integration Testing

Integration tests are executed as part of the CI workflow.

4️⃣ Static Code Analysis - SonarQube

SonarQube performs code quality and security analysis.

Validations Performed
• Bugs Detection
• Vulnerabilities
• Code Smells
• Maintainability Analysis
• Security Hotspots
5️⃣ Maven Build & Packaging

Application is packaged into an executable JAR file using Maven.

6️⃣ Docker Image Build

The Spring Boot application is containerized using Docker.

Docker Features
• Lightweight container image
• Portable deployment
• Consistent runtime environment
7️⃣ Trivy Vulnerability Scanning

Trivy scans the Docker image for:

• Critical Vulnerabilities
• High Severity CVEs
• Misconfigurations
8️⃣ DockerHub Push

Successfully validated Docker images are pushed securely to DockerHub.

9️⃣ Docker Cleanup

Local Docker images and temporary resources are cleaned up after execution.

🔧 Jenkins Integrations
✅ SonarQube Integration
• SonarQube Server Configuration
• Authentication using Access Tokens
• Jenkins-SonarQube Integration
• Quality Gate Validation
✅ DockerHub Integration
• Secure DockerHub Credentials
• Automated Docker Login
• Image Push Automation
✅ Shared Library Integration

Reusable Jenkins pipeline functions implemented using Jenkins Shared Libraries for modular and maintainable pipeline code.

📊 Project Validation

The following validations were successfully completed:

• ✅ Maven Build Success
• ✅ Unit Test Execution
• ✅ Integration Test Execution
• ✅ Docker Image Build
• ✅ DockerHub Push
• ✅ Jenkins Pipeline Automation
• ✅ Shared Library Integration

⚠️ Infrastructure Notes

Due to EC2 infrastructure resource limitations during testing:

• SonarQube Quality Gate stage was temporarily skipped
• Trivy scan stage was temporarily disabled during final execution

These stages were successfully configured and tested independently during implementation.
